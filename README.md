## Project: Analyzing US wildfire 
### Motivation: 
Wildfire is one of the most destructive disasters that are oftentimes caused by human. Averagely, there are more than 100,000 wildfires in the US every year, clearing 4 to 5 million acres of land and causing huge economic loss. However, naturally occurred wildfires play an important role in the ecosystem. This project aims at providing insights on wildfires and making useful suggestions to minimize economic loss from future wildfires by analyzing recorded wildfires happened in the US during 1992 and 2015.

### Problem observed: 
1)	Firefighting is expensive.
Analyzing the geographical information on where and when the wildfires occurred could provide useful information to identify high-risk areas that are vulnerable to wildfires, therefore help making better strategies on where fire-fighting forces are located and how to improve respond time to wildfires.
2)	Reasons for many destructive wildfires are not identified.
Reasons for lot of wildfires that burned millions of acres are missing or unidentified. Knowing the reasons for these wildfires could be crucial for future preventive measures on human-caused wildfires. 
This project aims at providing insightful information from analyzing historical data and utilizing appropriate machine learning techniques to solve above problems.

### Finishing product:
A web application that contains: 
1)	Interactive page where users can select a state and view relevant statistical analysis and data visualizations on historical data. 
2)	Prediction of the causes on historically unidentified wildfires.
3)	Useful recommendations on future improvements and potential preventive measures.

### Structure of the project:
#### Section I: Preparing Data
This section will focus on cleaning data and generating necessary variables to the following exploratory analysis and data visualization. 

The main dataset for this project is from USDA Forest Service: [link](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Product/RDS-2013-0009.4/)

In order to provide a deeper understanding on why wildfires occurred, geographical and weather information will also be added based on data availability. 

#### Section II: Exploratory Analysis and Data Visualization
This section will focus on conducting statistical analysis on historical data to provide insights on when, where, and why wildfires occurred. This section will also identify the most destructive wildfires in the sample period and analysis their reasons, location, burning time, and, other environmental/geographical factors (e.g. weather, temperature, nearby camping sites, residential areas). This will provide a deeper understanding on where the most destructive wildfires are most likely to happen. 
Potential questions to answer:
-	Did most destructive wildfires happen on days with low humidity and high temperature?
-	What factor contributes the most to the burning time of a wildfire? (firefighting resources, fire size, or close to residential areas ??)
-	What kind of environment is most likely to trigger a wildfire? (especially human-caused wildfires)
#### Section III: Machine Learning

#### Section IV: Recommendations
